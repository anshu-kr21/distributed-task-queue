# �� Distributed Task Queue & Job Processor (Simplified)
## Overview
Build a small-scale **distributed job queue and worker system**
.\
It should let authenticated users submit tasks, process them with worker
nodes, and track progress in real time through a simple dashboard.
The system should be reliable, durable, and observable --- but only to a
**prototype level** (about 10 hours of effort).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## �� Core Requirements
### 1. Job API
- REST or gRPC API for:
- Submitting a job (JSON payload)
- Checking job status (pending, running, done, failed)
- Support optional **idempotency key** to avoid duplicate jobs.
### 2. Persistence
- Use a small database or file-backed store (e.g., SQLite, Redis,
Postgres).
- Jobs should survive restarts.
### 3. Workers
- Poll jobs from the queue.
- Process them with **lease + ack + retry** logic:
- Lease: mark job as running.
- Ack: mark done.
- Retry: re-queue failed jobs (up to N retries).
- Failed jobs after max retries go to **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**
.
### 4. Rate Limits / Quotas
- Enforce a per-tenant (user) limit:
- e.g., max 5 concurrent jobs.
- simple rate limiting (e.g., 10 new jobs/minute).
### 5. Dashboard (Basic UI)
- Responsive web app (React or simple HTML + JS).
- Show:
- Pending / Running / Completed / Failed jobs
- DLQ items
- Use WebSockets or polling for live updates.
### 6. Observability
- Log every major event (submit, start, finish, fail).
- Expose simple metrics (e.g., total jobs, failed jobs, retries).
- Include trace IDs or job IDs in logs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
## �� Optional / Conceptual Add-Ons (Stretch)
- Auto-scale workers (document how it would work, not required to
implement).
- Include brief notes on design trade-offs in a short README.

## ✅ Evaluation Focus
Area What we'll look for
------------------- ------------------------------------------
**Correctness** Retry / lease / ack logic works properly
**Reliability** Jobs persist and recover on restart
**API & UX** Clear endpoints and functional UI
**Observability** Logs + simple metrics
**Code Quality** Structure, comments, simple tests
